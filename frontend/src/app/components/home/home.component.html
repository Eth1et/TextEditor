      <p class="document-text">
        Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
        simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
        McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
        Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
        sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
        Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
        treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes
        from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used
        since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are
        also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English
        versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some?
        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
        majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
        randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
        going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
        anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
        necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses
        a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
        sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
        generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
        humour, or non-characteristic words etc. Where does it come from?
